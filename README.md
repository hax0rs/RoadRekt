##  What is it?

  SafeRoad is designed as a platform for mainentance and further development of
  road infrastructure and assist to promote safer driving and potentially
  reduce congestion on roads already being strained and deemed unsafe. The
  services aims to allow the user to view a heatmap of areas in which road
  accidents occur and the prominence and severity of the accident. Furthermore
  the service aims to allow users to filter information using road conditions
  (wet, clear, foggy, etc.) and view data regarding crash occurences relating
  to the time of day aswell as trends exhibited over the years.
  It is the [hax0r](https://github.com/hax0rs) team submission for
  GovHack BNE 2015.
