##  What is it?

  SafeRoad is designed as a platform for finding high risk road areas. It can 
  be used in planning mainentance and further development of road 
  infrastructure such as signage, traffic flow management and road resurfacing.
  It can also assist in planning new emergnecy service home-base locations.
  For the public, the service highlights roads of high risk and could act to
  reduce road use in high-use and high-risk areas.

  SafeRoad aims to allow the user to view a heatmap of areas in which road
  accidents occur and the prominence and severity of the accident. Furthermore
  the service aims to allow users to filter information using road conditions
  (wet, clear, foggy, etc.) and view data regarding crash occurences relating
  to the time of day aswell as trends exhibited over the years. It is the
  [UQ Hax0rs](https://github.com/hax0rs) team submission for GovHack BNE 2015.
